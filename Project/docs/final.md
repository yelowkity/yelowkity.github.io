Title: Community Centers
Team Members: Lyudmyla Whalen
Link: cd -> "nmp run start-watch" or "npm start" 
The problem that we tried to solve is to provide the location, distance, addressesa nd names of desired/searched community centers.
The Stakeholders are the community members and anyone who needs some geo information about any community centers in the area
Data to work with was json file from PG county web site:https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/resource/gwq4-iu9d.json
Used search function and distance on earch between two points function (both can be googled/opensourse)
System will run on iOS and Windows.
Systems meets the requirements of filtering the data per the distance and center names
Normal challenges to google stuff online and trying to put it together
